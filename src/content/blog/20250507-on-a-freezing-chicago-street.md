# on a freezing chicago street

Two years ago, I nearly died.

There was no bright light. No revelation. Just a suffocating pressure on my head and the sterile rhythm of a machine breathing for me. I was lying in an ICU bed in Chicago, fully conscious, and thinking: *If no one had called the ambulance, who would have died?*

The answer was obvious - and terrifying. It was me. But not just the version of me in that bed. It was the version of me I used to be.

## default mode

Eight years earlier, I was relentless. In college, I made challenges for fun. Engineering classes were a launchpad for business ideas. Clubs were experiments in rethinking how the world worked. Nobody set the bar for me. I built it and cleared it myself.

But by the time I landed in that hospital bed, I’d stopped doing that. I was living life in “default mode.”

Like pressing tab in Cursor, letting autofill just guess at what's next.

Things weren’t bad, objectively. I had a well-paying 9–5 that I could crush in five hours. A lively SF social life. More than enough income to live outside my means. But I was numb. Checking off all the right boxes and feeling absolutely nothing.

Back home, I opened my career planning doc. At the top of the page:

**"L4 – Lead ⭐"**

It hit me like a punch. I wasn’t living like this by accident. I was addicted to exceeding expectations. I was manufacturing wins by lowering the bar for myself and scoring quick hits from others. And it worked, until it didn’t.

## lowering the bar

I've taken every job a recruiter handed me. If someone laid out a neat little problem - slide deck, PRD, campaign - I could crush it. The bar was set. I could jump over it, impress a few people, and rack up the dopamine.

Professionally, I made a habit of bottlenecking myself just enough to look scrappy. I could beat the goal, look like a hero, and bunny hop my way up the ladder.

Socially, it was the same playbook. Parties, kickball leagues, surface-level momentum. Nothing bad, but nothing challenging either. I’d stopped pushing myself in the ways that used to make me feel alive.

Everywhere I looked, I was chasing the short-term hit of winning at someone else’s game. And deep down, I knew it.

## changing my settings

When I got back to San Francisco, I unraveled. Told my team I was moving to New York. Told my partner the same. Cleaned my apartment, trashed old clothes, rearranged my life like it was a crime scene.

And then I stopped.

Because the problem wasn’t SF vs. New York. It wasn't my LinkedIn. It wasn’t my friends.

It was systemic. I didn’t need to change the backdrop - I needed to start writing the script.

## what now

Two years and two jobs later, I’m finally starting to feel like myself again. I just accepted another role - yes, through a recruiter - but this time because it’s a zero-to-one challenge. No one to impress but me.

I’m also moving in with the woman I love. The same one I almost walked away from when I thought I needed a dramatic escape to feel something again.

Now? I’m ready to build something instead.

## the plan

**Career**: I’m joining Gitpod as a Sr. PMM, helping them scale into their Series B. Guardrails exist, but the path isn’t paved. I’ll be documenting my journey into self-authorship, and finally shipping a story I’m choosing to write.

**Personal**: To reignite the spark, I’m starting something small but real: biking every single bike lane in San Francisco. It’s physical, creative, and grounded in a city I love. I’ll be filming, photographing, and posting as I go. SF has so much potential. We just need new ways of seeing it.

**Social**: You won’t see as much about this here, but the principle’s the same: focus on depth over noise. My time’s going to the people who matter—my partner, my family, my close friends, and, yeah, myself.

This isn’t a rebrand. It’s not some productivity hack or curated journey.

It’s just me, finally choosing to stop pressing Tab.

**Time to write the whole damn line.**
