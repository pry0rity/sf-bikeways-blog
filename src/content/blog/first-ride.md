Today marked my first official ride for the SF Bikeways blog, and what better way to start than with San Francisco's most famous bike route - The Wiggle! This zigzagging path through the Lower Haight and Duboce Triangle neighborhoods is a perfect example of how San Francisco's bike infrastructure has evolved to work with the city's challenging topography.

## The Route

The Wiggle is a 1.5-mile route that follows the path of least resistance through the city's hills, connecting Market Street to Golden Gate Park. It's a perfect example of how thoughtful bike infrastructure can make cycling accessible to everyone, regardless of fitness level.

## Coffee Stop

I made a pit stop at Ritual Coffee Roasters on Haight Street. Their pour-over coffee was the perfect fuel for the rest of the ride. The shop has a great bike rack out front and plenty of space to park your ride while you enjoy your coffee.

## Gear Thoughts

The Surly Straggler handled the city's varied terrain beautifully. Its steel frame provided a smooth ride over San Francisco's notorious potholes, while the disc brakes gave me confidence on the descents. The Fujifilm X100V was perfect for capturing the city's character without being too bulky.

## Final Thoughts

The Wiggle is a testament to San Francisco's commitment to making cycling accessible. The route is well-marked, relatively flat, and connects to many other bike lanes throughout the city. It's a perfect example of how good bike infrastructure can encourage more people to choose cycling as their mode of transportation.

Stay tuned for more rides and routes as I continue to explore San Francisco's bike lanes!
