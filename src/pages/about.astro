    <h1>About SF Bikeways</h1>

    <p>
      I'm biking every single bike lane in San Francisco. No exceptions, no
      shortcuts.
    </p>

    <p>
      This started as a way to break out of autopilot mode. Instead of chasing
      the next big thing, I'm exploring the city I already love - one lane at a
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll find photos, stories, and coffee shop stops along the way. No gear
      reviews, no productivity hacks. Just raw documentation of what it's like
      to see San Francisco from every possible angle on two wheels.
    </p>

    <p>
      Want to follow along? I'm documenting the whole thing here. Have a
      favorite lane or coffee shop to recommend? Drop me a line.
