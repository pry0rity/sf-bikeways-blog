	<h1>About SF Bikeways</h1>

	<p>
		I'm biking every single bike lane in San Francisco. No exceptions, no shortcuts.
	</p>

	<p>
		This started as a way to break out of autopilot mode. Instead of chasing the next big
		thing, I'm exploring the city I already love - one lane at a time.
	</p>

	<p>
		You'll find photos, stories, and coffee shop stops along the way. No gear reviews, no
		productivity hacks. Just raw documentation of what it's like to see San Francisco from
		every possible angle on two wheels.
	</p>

	<p>
		Want to follow along? I'm documenting the whole thing here. Have a favorite lane or coffee
		shop to recommend? Drop me a line.
